## Problem Statement

Challenge IV – FMCG (Asian Paints)

Large FMCG companies manually process B2B RFPs and tenders by:
- Reading complex PDFs
- Matching products manually
- Estimating bid prices
- Creating tender response documents

This process is slow, error-prone, and inconsistent.

Our solution automates:
- RFP identification
- Product matching
- Pricing estimation
- Win probability prediction
- Tender response generation
