## Prompt Strategy Summary

The system uses structured prompts for:

1. Tender Requirement Extraction
   - Identify product type
   - Quantity
   - Technical specifications

2. Product Matching
   - Exact match scoring
   - Nearest match suggestion
   - Gap analysis

3. Bid Recommendation
   - Profit margin threshold
   - Historical win patterns
   - Discount optimization

Prompts are deterministic and domain-constrained to reduce hallucination.
